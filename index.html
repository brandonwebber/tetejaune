			<em><ul>
			<li>Have you always had a burning question to ask a designer?</li>
			<li>Do you wonder what is ‘happening’ in the design community in Edmonton?</li>
			<li>Want to know how a designer approaches a new project?</li>
			</ul></em>
			<p>If you have a question for any of the designers, send them to Carmen Douville at <a href="mailto:carmen@withavec.com">carmen@withavec.com</a></p>
			<p>Bushel is hosting an afternoon panel discussion with three of Edmontons talented designers: Brad Goertz (<a href="http://www.nomadicinfrastructurelabs.ca/">Nomadic Infrastructure Labs</a>), Jordan Tomnuk (<a href="http://tomnuk.com/">Tomnuk Design</a>) and Britt Reed (<a href="http://www.coroflot.com/brittreed">Industrial Design Student, University of Alberta</a>). Each varying in experience and design background, these designers will share there thoughts on design, facilitated by Carmen Douville (Co-Founder, <a href="https://www.loyalloot.com/">Loyal Loot Collective</a>).</p>
			<h3>Designer Bios:</h3>
			<p><strong>Brad Goertz</strong><br/>
				Brad Goertz grew up on a farm in northern Alberta before receiving a formal education in philosophy and political studies. The call to work with his hands forced an end to a promising career in politics and drug dealing in Asia.<br/>
				<br/>Classically trained as a furniture maker and somewhat suspicious of the role (tyranny) of digital technology in design. Brad also co-founded the cooperative studio Ficus in 2011.</p>
			<p><strong>Britt Reed</strong><br/>
				Britt Reed is a full time student in the Bachelor of Design program at the U of A studying industrial design. Here she has explored the many realms of industrial design, from medical products to furniture, which have helped to define her philosophy and process. Working with Oliver Apartment over the 2014 summer, she was given the opportunity to design pieces for some of Edmonton's newest experiences, such as serving boards for Rostizado and the "eat, drink, and think" bars for the Host Edmonton event. As a designer, she aims to bring simple and unique solutions into the world, and by objectifying every decision along the way she hopes her designs will have a lasting impact in people's lives. Through critical thinking, a clean aesthetic and craftsmanship, honesty in materials, and simplicity, Britt's work shows an appreciation for both the process and product. </p>
			<p><strong>Jordan Tomnuk</strong><br/>
				For Jordan, design is about innovation, questioning the conventional, observing, and understanding how to make things work better.<br/><br/>
				His interest in design led him to the University of Alberta’s Bachelor of Design program where he studied Industrial Design, with a focus on furniture and product design.<br/><br/>
				Since graduating in 2011, he has set forth in creating his own line of products that he feels connected to and passionate about, having been designed, tested and manufactured all on his own. It is his mission to create quality products that are built to last.</p>
			<h2>Friday Event Launch</h2>
