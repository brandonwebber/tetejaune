			<em><ul>
			<li>Have you always had a burning question to ask a designer?</li>
			<li>Do you wonder what is ‘happening’ in the design community in Edmonton?</li>
			<li>Want to know how a designer approaches a new project?</li>
			</ul></em>
			<p>If you have a question for any of the designers, send them to Carmen Douville at <a href="mailto:carmen@withavec.com">carmen@withavec.com</a></p>
			<p>Bushel is hosting an afternoon panel discussion with three of Edmontons talented designers: Brad Goertz (<a href="http://www.nomadicinfrastructurelabs.ca/">Nomadic Infrastructure Labs</a>), Jordan Tomnuk (<a href="http://tomnuk.com/">Tomnuk Design</a>) and Britt Reed (<a href="http://www.coroflot.com/brittreed">Industrial Design Student, University of Alberta</a>). Each varying in experience and design background, these designers will share there thoughts on design, facilitated by Carmen Douville (Co-Founder, <a href="https://www.loyalloot.com/">Loyal Loot Collective</a>).</p>
			<h3>Designer Bios:</h3>
			<p><strong>Brad Goertz</strong><br/>
				Brad Goertz grew up on a farm in northern Alberta before receiving a formal education in philosophy and political studies. The call to work with his hands forced an end to a promising career in politics and drug dealing in Asia.<br/>
				<br/>Classically trained as a furniture maker and somewhat suspicious of the role (tyranny) of digital technology in design. Brad also co-founded the cooperative studio Ficus in 2011.</p>
			<p><strong>Britt Reed</strong><br/>
				Britt Reed is a full time student in the Bachelor of Design program at the U of A studying industrial design. Here she has explored the many realms of industrial design, from medical products to furniture, which have helped to define her philosophy and process. Working with Oliver Apartment over the 2014 summer, she was given the opportunity to design pieces for some of Edmonton's newest experiences, such as serving boards for Rostizado and the "eat, drink, and think" bars for the Host Edmonton event. As a designer, she aims to bring simple and unique solutions into the world, and by objectifying every decision along the way she hopes her designs will have a lasting impact in people's lives. Through critical thinking, a clean aesthetic and craftsmanship, honesty in materials, and simplicity, Britt's work shows an appreciation for both the process and product. </p>
			<p><strong>Jordan Tomnuk</strong><br/>
				For Jordan, design is about innovation, questioning the conventional, observing, and understanding how to make things work better.<br/><br/>
				His interest in design led him to the University of Alberta’s Bachelor of Design program where he studied Industrial Design, with a focus on furniture and product design.<br/><br/>
				Since graduating in 2011, he has set forth in creating his own line of products that he feels connected to and passionate about, having been designed, tested and manufactured all on his own. It is his mission to create quality products that are built to last.</p>-->

			<h3>About The Show</h3><br>
			<p>Tête Jaune Design Show is an exhibition from and for the Canadian Prairies. We want to create a platform for designers to share their work with you, and we hope to open the discussion of what constitutes a “prairie aesthetic". We believe that our environment influences what we create, and through our work we might better understand the place we call home.<p><br>
			<p><em>We aim to promote great work from the Canadian prairies. We also aim to be inclusive. Our design shows hold open calls for work from any part of the Canadian prairies. Please sign up for our newsletter to hear when our next call is.</em></p><br>
			<h4>T&ecirc;te Jaune</h4><br>
			<p>Translated as ’Yellowhead’ in english, Tête Jaune was a Métis Fur Trapper who also was known as Pierre Bostonais or Pierre Hastination. He was a guide for the Hudson’s Bay Company starting in 1819. Because of his blonde hair he received the nickname Tête Jaune. As a guide he helped lead HBC expeditions through mountain passes and to and from fur caches in the Canadian Rockies. The Yellowhead pass and Tête Jaune Cache still bear his name and mark the land he helped explore. Tête Jaune and his family, along with his brother Baptiste and his family, were slain in 1828 by Beaver Indians as retaliation for territorial pressure from hunting and fur trapping in the area.</p><br>
			<p>Tête Jaune’s identity is complicated. To some he was an Iroquois, or Iroquois Métis - possibly also having American heritage - living in the prairies. To some, he was seen as a white immigrant from the east. Along with other famous Métis of the Canadian Rockies - such as Jasper Haws - Tête Jaune’s legacy can be felt all across the prairies. From the Yellowhead highway that spans across Western Canada, to the many places that still use Yellowhead or Tête Jaune as their name, this man and his story have left their mark. We are inspired by his story as well as his contribution to history and we are honoured to be able to help share it in a small part.</p><br>
			<p>Yvette Vinson, 90 years old and living in Hinton Alberta is a direct descendant of Tête Jaune through Louis Loyer, who in an interview stated that Tête Jaune was his grandfather. The larger Vinson family also live in the Hinton, Brule, and Grande Cache areas, and still operate small businesses as hosts and horse pack guides - like their family before them have done for many years. They are happy to see Tête Jaune honoured as a figure in Prairie and Canadian history.</p><br>
			<p><em>Special thanks to Yvette Vinson and family from Hinton and Brule Alberta who have helped us better understand their family heritage and Tête Jaune’s story. Thanks also to the <a href="http://mountainmetis.com">Mountain Métis Council</a> from Grande Cache Alberta for resources and family connections.</em></p>
